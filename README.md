# Python Pieces
Python Pieces is an educational programming environment for Python, boasting an intuitive drag-and-drop interface with touch-screen compatibility. It is designed with the 10 to 14-year old beginning programmer: the student experience centers around using draggable Code BLocks to create Python programs. Teachers can use Python Pieces to prepare lessons and even integrate students programs with external code.

Python Pieces is written in (of course) Python, and uses the Kivy framework, which can be downloaded and installed from kivy.org. Currently, Python Pieces has only been tested on Windows. A Mac-compatible version should be forthcoming. (A Raspberry-Pi version is also a future possibility).

As with most Kivy projects, the program is started by running main.py.

Python Pieces was developed during the Spring semester of 2015 for Princeton's CS Department's Undergraduate Independent Work.
The project was advised by Dr. Christopher Moretti.
